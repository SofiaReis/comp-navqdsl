NAVQDSL: A DSL for specifying queries in navigation systems graphs for Java 

Description: This project shall define a DSL for specifying graph queries in the context of navigation systems. A framework shall process an input query and then apply it to graphs (an existent graph library shall be used). Examples of graphs to evaluate the framework will be provided. 

Example of Input:
Output 10 paths from “A” to “B”: criteria: shortest Output places with distance <= 3 places from “A” Output 10 paths from “A” to “B”: criteria: fastest
